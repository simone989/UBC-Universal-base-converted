Step 1 Convert, if necessary, the number in base 10.
result = a1 + a2 * 10 ^ n * 10 ^ (n-1) + a3 * 10 ^ (n-2) + ... + a (n-1) * 10 ^ (n- (n-1)) + n * 10 ^ (n)
Step 2: Now divide the result by the final base,
the remainder of the division will be the first digit (least significant).
continues dividing the result of the division to the base end,
the rest will be 'the second least significant digit.
continued so until you find the final result.
